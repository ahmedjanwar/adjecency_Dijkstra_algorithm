# Dijkstra Algorithm for Shortest Paths

This Python script demonstrates Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted, undirected graph. It generates adjacency lists, converts them to an adjacency matrix, and then applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance from a specified node to all other nodes in the graph.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the script on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- numpy library (you can install it using `pip install numpy`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git](https://github.com/ahmedjanwar/adjecency_Dijkstra_algorithm)https://github.com/ahmedjanwar/adjecency_Dijkstra_algorithm```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.

2. Run the script by executing the following command:
   
   ```python dijkstra_algorithm.py```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide your student number.

4. The script will calculate and display the shortest distances from a specified node to all other nodes in the graph.

## Graph Definition
The graph is defined in the code with the following edges:

A to B: Weight 3
B to H: Weight 1
A to G: Weight 3
A to D: Weight 7
H to G: Weight 1
D to C: Weight 1
D to S: Weight 3
C to G: Weight 8
C to S: Weight 9
G to S: Weight 4
D to E: Weight 2
E to F: Weight 6
S to T: Weight 2
E to T: Weight 1

## Results

The script will output the shortest distances from a specified node (determined by your student number) to all other nodes in the graph.
